// - You have to take five numbers, stored in variables with the following names
    
//      one, two, three, four, five, six

// The value stored in the variable`two, five, six`has been doubled, such that if initially the value was 3, it has become 6

// The value stored in the variable`three, four`has been increased three times, such that if initially it was 3, it has become 9

// The value stored in the variable `one` has not been changed.

// Find the sum of the updated values stored in`one, two, three, four, five, six`
